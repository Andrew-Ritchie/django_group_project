#1 Application Overview
We have decided to create a platform for people to share all things cooking. This will be a recipe website with an emphasis on shairng specific information, by encouraging people to post photos, recipes and share ideas. Our team has decided to create a platform to allow users access to recipes, as well as post their own recipes with any type of media: videos, images, etc. Futhermore other than sharing their own recipes, we will allow users to follow different content creators and provide a feed of personalised recipes, based on previous recipes that the user has viewed or by different creators they have followed.

#2 Specification
##2.1 Functionality
1. Users sign up and manage their account: profile, posts, feed, etc.  
2. Search box to search for recipes and other users.  
3. Allow users to post in structured manner: a section for image, section for method and a section for ingredients.  
4. Allow users to browse through different catagories and content creators via menus and submenus.

##2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies
We are assuming that users will want to post recipes in a structured format, that is: uploading a picture of the finished product; entering key details such as the ingredients list; method taken to reproduce recipe and how many people it serves.

##2.3 Developments Methods
We will use a version control system to collabrate, the specific tools being git and github. To implement the project we will be using Python with the Django framework as well as several different other programming languages and tools such as photoshop for site graphics.
